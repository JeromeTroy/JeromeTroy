### Welcome!


A bit about me:

I am a mathematician at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab.
I work on uncertainty quantification and stochastic processes.

- Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun facts: I enjoy snowboarding in the mountains and kayaking with my pup!

Here is a simulation I made of sound waves propagating through a set of exhaust tips using FEniCS
